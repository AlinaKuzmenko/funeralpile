export const story = 'Funeral Pile combines elements of epic doom metal, melodic (post) black metal and neck-breaking old school death metal in a way not heard before. They shape their songs with furious vocals, cutting riffs, melodic lead guitars, grooving basslines and hard drum attacks in a way that they form a coherent and varied combination. In doing so, they alternately invite you to let your thoughts circle, or letting out the pent-up rage and go to the groove of the music.\n'
  + '|Originally formed in 2008 and put on hold before their first release, the core of the band reunited in 2020 as a studio project.
